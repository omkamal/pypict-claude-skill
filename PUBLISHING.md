This guide will walk you through publishing the pypict-claude-skill repository to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

## Step-by-Step Publishing Process

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Configure your repository:
   - **Repository name:** `pypict-claude-skill`
   - **Description:** "A Claude skill for designing comprehensive test cases using PICT (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing)"
   - **Visibility:** Public (so others can use it)
   - **Initialize:** DO NOT add README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Initialize Local Git Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the pypict-claude-skill directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/pypict-claude-skill

# Initialize git repository
git init

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pypict-claude-skill.git

# Verify remote is set correctly
git remote -v
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch (or master if using older git)
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
