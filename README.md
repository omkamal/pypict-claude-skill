## üéØ What is PICT?

PICT (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing) is a combinatorial testing tool developed by Microsoft. It generates test cases that efficiently cover all pairwise combinations of parameters while drastically reducing the total number of tests compared to exhaustive testing.

**Example:** Testing a system with 8 parameters and 3-5 values each:
- Exhaustive testing: **25,920 test cases**
- PICT pairwise testing: **~30 test cases** (99.88% reduction!)

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Test Case Generation**: Converts requirements into structured PICT models
- **Constraint-Based Testing**: Applies business rules to eliminate invalid combinations
- **Expected Output Generation**: Automatically determines expected results for each test case
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures all pairwise parameter interactions are tested
- **Multiple Domains**: Works for software functions, APIs, web forms, configurations, and more

2. **Extract to the skills directory**:

```bash
# For personal use (all projects)
unzip pypict-claude-skill-main.zip
mv pypict-claude-skill-main ~/.claude/skills/pict-test-designer

# For project-specific use
unzip pypict-claude-skill-main.zip
mv pypict-claude-skill-main .claude/skills/pict-test-designer
```

### Verify Installation

After installation, restart Claude Code. The skill will load automatically when relevant. You can verify by asking Claude:

```
Do you have access to the pict-test-designer skill?
```

Or simply start using it:

```
Design test cases for a login function with username, password, and remember me checkbox.
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Once installed, you can use the skill in Claude by simply asking:

```
Design test cases for a login function with username, password, and remember me checkbox.
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze the requirements
2. Identify parameters and values
3. Generate a PICT model with constraints
4. Create test cases with expected outputs
5. Present results in a formatted table

## üìä Example: ATM System Testing

This repository includes a complete real-world example of testing an ATM system. See the [examples](examples/) directory for:

- **[ATM Specification](examples/atm-specification.md)**: Complete ATM system specification with 11 sections covering hardware, software, security, and functional requirements
- **[ATM Test Plan](examples/atm-test-plan.md)**: Comprehensive test plan generated using PICT methodology with 31 test cases (reduced from 25,920 possible combinations)

### ATM Example Summary

**System Parameters:**
- Transaction Types (5): Withdrawal, Deposit, Balance Inquiry, Transfer, PIN Change
- Card Types (3): EMV Chip, Magnetic Stripe, Invalid
- PIN Status (4): Valid, Invalid attempts 1-3
- Account Types (3): Checking, Savings, Both
- Transaction Amounts (4): Within limits, at max, exceeds transaction, exceeds daily
- Cash Availability (3): Sufficient, Insufficient, Empty
- Network Status (3): Primary, Backup, Disconnected
- Card Condition (3): Good, Damaged, Expired

**Test Results:**
- Total possible combinations: **25,920**
- PICT test cases generated: **31**
- **Reduction: 99.88%**
- Coverage: All pairwise (2-way) interactions
- Test execution time: Reduced from weeks to hours

### Running the ATM Example

```bash
# In Claude Code
Ask: "Use the pict-test-designer skill to analyze the ATM specification 
in examples/atm-specification.md and generate test cases"
```

## üîç How It Works

### 1. Requirements Analysis

Claude analyzes your requirements to identify:
- **Parameters**: Input variables, configuration options, environmental factors
- **Values**: Possible values using equivalence partitioning
- **Constraints**: Business rules and dependencies
- **Expected Outcomes**: What should happen for different combinations

### 2. PICT Model Generation

Creates a structured model:

```
# Parameters
Browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
OS: Windows, MacOS, Linux
Memory: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB

# Constraints
IF [OS] = "MacOS" THEN [Browser] <> "IE";
IF [Memory] = "4GB" THEN [OS] <> "MacOS";
```

### 3. Test Case Generation

Generates minimal test cases covering all pairwise combinations:

| Test # | Browser | OS | Memory | Expected Output |
|--------|---------|----|---------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | Chrome | Windows | 4GB | Success |
| 2 | Firefox | MacOS | 8GB | Success |
| 3 | Safari | Linux | 16GB | Success |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 4. Expected Output Determination

For each test case, Claude determines the expected outcome based on:
- Business requirements
- Code logic
- Valid/invalid combinations

## üéØ Use Cases

### Software Testing
- Function testing with multiple parameters
- API endpoint testing
- Database query testing
- Algorithm validation

### Configuration Testing
- System configuration combinations
- Feature flag testing
- Environment setup validation
- Browser compatibility testing

### Web Application Testing
- Form validation
- User authentication flows
- E-commerce checkout processes
- Shopping cart functionality

### Mobile Testing
- Device and OS combinations
- Screen size and orientation
- Network conditions
- App permissions

### Hardware Testing
- Device compatibility
- Interface testing
- Protocol validation
- Performance under different conditions

## üìö Documentation

- **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)**: Complete skill documentation with workflow and best practices
- **[PICT Syntax Reference](references/pict_syntax.md)**: Complete syntax guide (to be created)
- **[Examples](references/examples.md)**: Real-world examples across domains (to be created)
- **[Helper Scripts](scripts/pict_helper.py)**: Python utilities for PICT (to be created)

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Good Parameter Names
‚úÖ Use descriptive names: `AuthMethod`, `UserRole`, `PaymentType`
‚úÖ Apply equivalence partitioning: `FileSize: Small, Medium, Large`
‚úÖ Include boundary values: `Age: 0, 17, 18, 65, 66`
‚úÖ Add negative values: `Amount: ~-1, 0, 100, ~999999`

### Writing Constraints
‚úÖ Document rationale: `# Safari only available on MacOS`
‚úÖ Start simple, add incrementally
‚úÖ Test constraints work as expected

### Expected Outputs
‚úÖ Be specific: "Login succeeds, user redirected to dashboard"
‚ùå Not vague: "Works" or "Success"
